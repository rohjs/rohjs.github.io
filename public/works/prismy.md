## Concepts

* Asynchronously pick required values of a handler from context(which having HTTP Request obejct: IncomingMessage).
* Asynchronously execute the handler with the picked values.

## Features

* Very small (No Expressjs, the only deps are micro and tslib)
* Takes advantage of the asynchronous nature of Javascript with full support for async / await
* Simple and easy argument injection for handlers (Inpsired by Reselect)
  * Completely _TYPE-SAFE_
  * No more complicated classes / decorators, only simple functions
  * Highly testable (Request handlers can be tested without mocking request or sending actual http requests)
* Single pass (lambda) style composable middleware (Similar to Redux)
